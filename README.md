# A Beginner MERN Social Media Website

A project I created to learn more about react and MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJs, React.JS, Node.JS) tech stack.
However, unfortunately I did not bother to deploy it yet because I think in the future I may still work on this project to add more features. :)
And also Heroku is not free anymore since Nov. 2022....

## To run this app on your local machine:

1. download the repository to your local address;
2. open with any code editor (e.g. vscode) and open a terminal: 
      **Client side**: (1) cd client (2)npm run start; 
      **Server Side**: (1) cd server (2) npm run start;

For the front end I built it with React and for the backend with MongoDB. 
And to connect them I used ExpressJS and Node.JS.

## To show a quick demo of the website:

1. **LoginPage**, I achieved functions like register, login and authentication using **Morgan**, **jsonwebtoken**.
And during that it also accepts photos as profile picture, so I used **multer** and **multer-gridfs-storage** to upload.

**Preview of the LoginPage**:

2. **HomePage**

   In the homepage I achieved a **user widget** to show user information, a **post widget** to allow user to make posts similar to Twitter, a **friendPost** widget to show friends' posts, an **Ads widget** that shows advertisement and finally a **friendList widget** that show a list of your friends on the network.

## Future Work

I think I would consider about adding more features like payments, wallets and features like book a flight/hotel/rental car, and a chat system.
In the end, I project it to be a mix of Wechat, Twitter and Expedia.
